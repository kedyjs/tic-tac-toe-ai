# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe AI 🤖

Welcome to the Tic Tac Toe AI project! This project utilizes the Minimax algorithm to create a challenging artificial intelligence for the classic Tic Tac Toe game.


## 🚀 Features
- **Minimax Algorithm:** Implements the Minimax algorithm to determine the best move.
- **Player vs AI:** Allows a human player to play against the AI.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Provides a simple and interactive command-line interface for gameplay.

## 🛠️ Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python (3.8 or higher)

### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/kedyjs/tic-tac-toe-ai
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
   cd tic-tac-toe-ai
    ```
3. Run the game:
   ```sh
   python tic_tac_toe.py
   ```
# 🎮 How to Play

- The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
- You are X, and the AI is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
- The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
- When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.

# 📖 Algorithm
This project uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax Algorithm</a> which is a decision-making algorithm, used in two-player games like Tic Tac Toe. It computes the minimax decision from the current state, which will be used to determine the AI's move.
